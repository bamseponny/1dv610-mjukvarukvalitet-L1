# My Favorite Things

## Description
Very warm welcome to the My Favorite Things library. With this library you can take the favorite thing of your choice in one certain category – how about books, films, video games or tv shows? – and collect them in a library where you can sort them, for example, alphabetically and by grade.

## Installation
Open a termial in the application folder and input "npm install".

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
The idea with the library is to arrange, filter and keep track on certain collections. You can for example create web applications where you show off, sort and filter the collection in a number of ways.

It's really up to you to pick a suitable collection. In the code examples below you can see a collection of video games. This have been produced in the database.js file. This array of objects are you supposed to replace with your own collection.

```bash
export const library = [{
    title: 'Horizon Forbidden West',
    format: 'Playstation 5',
    releaseYear: 2022,
    genre: 'Action',
    series: 'Horizon',
    grade: 5
  }]
```

After producing your first iteration of the library (which can include one to many objects) 

## Contributing
Please reach out by open an issue on Github if you would like to make any major changes to the library's source code.
